    <p>Based on our proprietary algorithm, [INPUT COUNTRY] will need to pay a bribe to FIFA in the amount of [MONETARY AMOUNT] [INPUT COUNTRY CURRENCY]. Remember, FIFA only accepts bribes paid in the Swiss franc. So you'll need to give FIFA [MONETARY AMOUNT] francs.</p>

    <p>Oh, and since [INPUT COUNTRY] only has [NUMBER OF EXISTING STADIUMS] stadiums with a capacity of 60,000+ people, the good people of [INPUT COUNTRY] will need to build [NUMBER OF NEW STADIUMS NEEDED] new stadiums. The cost to build [NUMBER OF NEW STADIUMS] is only [MONETARY AMOUNT] [HOST COUNTRY CURRENCY].</p>
